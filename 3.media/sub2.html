            <p>In the past fishermen exchanged the treasures of the sea for the farmers’ vegetables and oil. This
              bartering created a fragnant cuisine based on seafood and “horta” (wild greens); fish stew (dentex, white
              grouper, dusky grouper ank monkfish), fava (puree of yellow split peas) with sardines, “tsoflia” (as the
              locals call crayfish and lobster) with courgettes and "horta" from the mountains. Chard, sow thistle,
              chervil, innumerable wild greens are married magically with seafood, highlighting the aromas of the place.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>You will find many varieties of fish and seafood in the rocky bays and small islets. The area around
              Lalaria, and around the islets, at Tsougrias or Kastro are spots that are considered ideal for fishing.
              Laid out in crates against the boats, pelagic fish for soups and grilling, bottom feeders for frying,
              squid, crayfish, prawns, lobster, cockles and mussels shimmer in the early light.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They are cooked in a variety of ways: we can enjoy squid with “horta” and onions, crayfish with
              courgettes and tomato, lobster with “horta”. Seafood is accompanied with vegetables and “horta”, with
              legumes and different sauces, each one special thanks to the herbs added, most frequently fennel which
              grows abundantly on the island. Green olives can also be marinated with fennel. Wild “horta” is also very
              tasty and goes well with seafood.</p>

          <span class="sub_title">Unique Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses and a treasure of wild
            mushrooms</span>
          <p>Mountainous for the most part, the land of Grevena favours livestock breeding, which has, for many
            centuries, been the main occupation of its inhabitants, especially the Vlachs and the Kopatsaraioi, whose
            clans used to spend the summer in the pastures of Mt Pindos, and then descended to the plains of Thessaly in
            the winter.
            As a result, the area to this day has a great cheese tradition, with the production of delicious products,
            mainly made of goat's and sheep's milk. Many of these cheeses have Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)
            status.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Anevato PDO cheese stands out as it is produced exclusively in the area of ​​Grevena and in the
            neighbouring province of Voio, Kozani, from local sheep’s and goat’s milk. It is a white, soft cheese,
            without shape or rind, with an almost creamy and grainy texture. It is found in all the tavernas of Grevena
            and it is characterized by its fresh, and appetizing sourish taste.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Batzos PDO cheese also hails from the dairy-making tradition of the local nomadic livestock breeders, who
            set up their makeshift cheese factories, the "batzaria", in the mountains of western and central Macedonia.
            It is a white semi-hard rindless brine cheese made from partially skimmed goat's and sheep's milk, with many
            small holes and a spicy, typically salty taste. It is ideal for grilling or frying.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Naturally, the list of Grevena dairy products would not be complete without feta (PDO), the most popular
            Greek cheese, as well as kaseri (PDO), which is very popular in northern Greece, and and it is manufactured
            mainly from sheep’s milk with the heated cheese mass technique. Other cheeses include kefalograviera (PDO),
            myzithra, anthotyro, soft and hard cheeses from local goat’s milk, butter and yogurt.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Adding fat-rich whey milk from batzo or kaseri (or from feta - although lower in fat) to full cream goat’s
            and sheep’s milk or cream creates the delicious, thick manouri (PDO) cheese. It is shaped like a cylindrical
            cane, and has a white, soft and compact mass without holes, a milky aroma, and a full, slightly salty
            flavour. It can be consumed on its own or used in cooking.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, Grevena is, above all, known for its mushrooms. The local dense forests, as well as the riverside
            areas, host an incredible variety of species, whose number may even exceed 2,000. Obviously, not all are
            edible. Practically speaking, about 50 species are collected, and of these, 20 are picked in sufficient
            quantities for commercial purposes. In recent years, mushroom picking has been transformed into a kind of
            local sport which the welcoming townspeople are always willing to introduce to any newcomer. Discover the
            specialized shops in the centre of Grevena, that sell mushroom products and organize mushroom hunting
            excursions with experienced guides. The ideal seasons to pick mushrooms are autumn and spring, especially
            after rainy periods since this much-adored fungus needs moisture to grow.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Despite the relatively limited arable land, Grevena is also famous for its grains and mainly legumes.
            Petura noodles and trachanas, sweet and sour, are also produced, mainly by local women’s cooperatives.</p>

                <h4>Wines of Santorini</h4>
                <span class="sub_title">If there was ever an island worthy of the nickname “the wine island”, then it is
                  undoubtedly Santorini.</span>
                <p>The excavations at the site of Akrotiri have proved that wine making and trading used to be among the
                  most important activities for prehistoric locals. Several eruptions of the volcano over the centuries
                  caused consecutive layers of volcanic matter, including ash, lava, and pumice to cover the limestone
                  and slate subsoil, forming what the locals call “aspa”, i.e. hard, solid ground. Over the years, grape
                  growers have built terraces using petrified lava stones in order to prevent the soil being eroded by
                  the strong winds, and to help retain what little rain falls.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks to geographical factors here, the vines are very healthy: the hot sun and strong winds dry up
                  any dampness on the fruit and prevent diseases and other problems such as mildew and botrytis.
                  In other words, the principles of organic cultivation are automatically applied here, as the growers
                  are left only with the tasks of sulphuration and pruning. The latter involves the use of a special
                  technique to form a “basket” within which the grapes are protected from the sand carried in the wind.

                <h4>Attica's Vineyards</h4>
                <p>Did you know that Athens is the only European capital where vineyards and wineries lie within a
                  stone’s throw from the city? Did you know that this region is the birthplace of the renowned retsina
                  wine? Let the aroma take you through memorable wine routes in one of the world’s oldest grapevine
                  plantations and try old classic or new labels in the cellars of local wineries. Feel the sweet
                  euphoria that lives in the magical world of wine.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Attica is a region favoured with a good climate: the winters are mild, the hours of sunshine many,
                  the local summer winds (meltemia) and the sea breeze lower the temperature in the summer and create
                  the ideal conditions for viticulture. 6,500 ha of grapevine fields, modern wineries that respect the
                  age-old winemaking tradition and indigenous superior quality varieties such as Savvatiano will take
                  you on a unique palatable journey across Attica. The history of the Attican vineyards goes hand in
                  hand with good quality, and modern technology helps enhance the production of fine wines. The wineries
                  are open to visitors for a tour around and some sampling before selection and purchase.

                <h4>Wines of Xanthi</h4>
                <span class="sub_title">From Homer’s Time to Today</span>
                <p>Viticulture has been a millennia-old thriving practice in Thrace, especially in the area near the
                  Thracian Sea, as per the ancient records.
                  In the Homeric epic, Odysseus offers the Giant Polyphemus wine from Ismaros port town, to get him
                  drunk. The centre of the ancient vinicultural
                  activities in the region was apparently located in the area of the mighty Avdira town, until it was
                  conquered by the Romans.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>An attempt to revive the vineyards of Xanthi, with Avdira as the hub of activity, started in the late
                  20th century, and is still ongoing, with a promising future, because tobacco isn’t as appealing as it
                  once was, making farmers switch to other more profitable crops, such as vineyards.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Sun-dried sweet wines originated from every part of Greece. Taste the worldwide famous Santorinian
                  Vinsanto, made by blending together the varieties of Assyrtiko and Aidani.The famous Vinsanto, a
                  luscious sweet wine, is made from sun-dried grapes and aged by law for at least three years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  A good Vinsanto, however, can easily age for more than 100 years. Vinsanto wines (the name means “wine
                  from Santorini” and not “holy wine,” as in the case of the similarly named vinosanto from Italy) have
                  a caramel- and toffee-like aspect, with a dried- fruit dimension that makes them great partners to all
                  sorts of sweets, especially chocolate. But what is really unique about Vinsanto goes back to the
                  individuality of the Assyrtico grape to begin with.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In comparison to other sweet Greek wines, Santorini's Vinsanto wines have a characteristic freshness,
                  thanks to all that natural Assyrtico acidity.</p>

            <p>Souma is a dodecanese alternative of ouzo or raki, which is going to amaze you! In Rhodes, it is mainly
              made from grape marc and wine, which makes the Rhodian Souma so special. You will find souma everywhere in
              restaurants, or even at cafes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When adding water or ice in Souma, it turns white with water like Ouzo does. Remember to take it easy

            <br>

            <span class="sub_title">The Greek liqueur made of leaves.</span>
            <p>Flourishing on the Cycladic island of Naxos, the citron tree produces citron leaves from which the
              exclusive Kitro liqueur is made. It is considered the driest and strongest of all Greek liqueurs with 36%
              vol.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite its high alcohol content, Kitro of Naxos is particularly sweet and aromatic, making it a
              favourite of even those who do not like strong distillates. It is a PDO product, produced in three main
              versions: white (strongest), green and yellow - making them very distinctive.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kitro of Naxos is a particularly elegant and aromatic spirit drink. Once served, it displays delicate
              aromas of sweet citrus fruits on the nose that follow through to the palate. It is drunk in destillate
              glasses and not only aids digestion, but is particularly pleasant as well. Moreover, it is rather mild and
              friendly on the palate, which is why it is preferred even by those who avoid the strongest of distillates.
              It can be used in cocktails and long drinks.</p>
