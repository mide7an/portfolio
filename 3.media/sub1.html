					<span class="sub_title">Eleven bridges of incomparable craftsmanship</span>
					<p>
						The dense network of small rivers, including Smixiotikos, Velonias, Dotsikiotikos and Pramoritsas, converge
						to create larger ones, such as Venetikos,
						Grevenitis and Stavropotamos, to finally end up in Aliakmonas, the largest river that flows entirely within
						Greece. Frequently impetuous, these rivers created difficulties
						in communication both between villages and among larger towns. This created the need for bridges, which was
						met by skilled stone masons,
						Epirotes and locals. Built mostly between the 18th and the 19th century, the stone bridges of Grevena have
						been declared scheduled monuments since 1995 and are of course a good reason to visit the area.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>The bridge of Stavropotamos over the like-named tributary, which converges with Venetikos River, is roughly
						20 km from Grevena, near Kipoureio village.
						The bridge was formerly part of the road from Thessaloniki to Ioannina. With four unequal large arches, it
						has a length of 48 metres and was built around 1880. Close by is Spanos bridge which links the two banks of
						the Venetikos River.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This five-arch bridge, made from skilfully hewn stones, reaches up to 85 metres in length and is the
						largest surviving stone bridge in Macedonia.
						The impressive three-arch bridge of Aziz Aga, which also bridges the Venetikos River, is near the village of
						Trikomo. The 70-metre-long bridge was
						built in 1727 as per the local tradition, after a number of hurdles were overcome, and its central arch has
						a 15-metre span. Near Trikomo,
						but more difficult to get to, is the double-arch Kagelia bridge stretching for 40 metres, also over the
						Venetikos River.</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Ziakas bridge, which was once part of Vasiliki Strata (Royal Road) leading to Thessaly region, is located
						just outside the village of the same name.
						It has two uneven arches and a length of 41 metres, spanning the banks of Velonias River. Portitsa bridge in
						the village of Spilaio is located at the exit
						of Portitsa gorge and is perhaps the most beautiful and popular bridge in the area.</p>

						<h4>Dispilio of Kastoria</h4>
						<span class="sub_title">The oldest Neolithic settlement in Europe</span>
						<p>The settlement of Dispilo, officially the oldest Neolithic settlement in Europe, is located 8km from the
							town of Kastoria (on the road Kastoria - Argos Orestiko).
							Dispilio was accidentally discovered when in 1932 the level of Kastoria lake dropped and traces of wooden
							stakes were revealed. </p>
						<br>
						<p>The excavations lasted many years and gradually brought to light invaluable finds dating back to the
							Neolithic era, including the plaque of Dispilio (5260 BC) around the end of the Middle Neolithic period.
							Excavations continued systematically at the site revealing more information about a large and structured
							lake settlement of the Middle and Late Neolithic era. It was not only the oldest found lake settlement
							found in Europe, but also one of great significance for the continent as well as for Greek archaeology, as
							it was the first one that was ever unearthed in the country.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Scholars have concluded that the settlement of Dispilo was a highly organized society of around 3,000
							people. The findings that have come to light prove that the inhabitants of the settlement made tools and
							utensils from everyday materials found in nature, bred animals, developed their own writing system and
							created an early form of music. They fished to cover their basic feeding needs and had found various ways
							to store food. The houses were either built in a circular or in a rectangular shape while some were placed
							in the lake, resting on stakes that protected them from water.</p>
